#### Title: Getting Started

#### Description

After having been planning this project for several years I am finally starting to develop it. I have no timeline for when this project will be operational. I hope to get a simple Minimum Viable Product, realistically just a Prototype, sometime in June 2024 for at least the Daily Log.

My goal with this project is to create a functional software suite for my tracking needs. I have been using a system in Excel for years and it is time I stopped procrastinating and created the dedicated software for the task. My hope is that this will be a good project to further refine my knowledge, skill, and experience. I also hope to learn more about front end development, as my experience with JavaScript is quite limited. I also hope to further understand API development and DevOps.

I am a data scientist first and foremost, not a software engineer or computer scientist. I plan on creating some machine learning algorithms when I can to analyze the data tracked. This software wont just be a database entry interface. I plan to implement useful analysis and visualization features, but to what extent will be determined during development.

#### Changes

- Created the Git repo on GitHub.
- Started to create the database in PostgreSQL.
